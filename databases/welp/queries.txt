In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt. Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt, along with the output from your database.
2) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses;
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|Amir's Towing
3|The Beagle Nightclub
4|Lotus Yoga
5|Plumbing by Janet
6|Sushi World
sqlite> SELECT * FROM users;
1|Bradford|Pitt
2|Mandy|Kaling
3|Angela|Jolie
4|Steven|Wonder
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews;
1|4|Great donuts|4|1
2|2|1 hour later than promised|2|3
3|3|HOT Yoga! Plenty HOT!|4|4
sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE businesses.id=reviews.business_id AND users.id=reviews.user_id;
4|Lotus Yoga|1|Bradford|Pitt|1|4|Great donuts|4|1
2|Amir's Towing|3|Angela|Jolie|2|2|1 hour later than promised|2|3
4|Lotus Yoga|4|Steven|Wonder|3|3|HOT Yoga! Plenty HOT!|4|4

3) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON businesses.id=reviews.business_id AND users.id=reviews.user_id;
Bradford|Pitt|Lotus Yoga|4|Great donuts
Angela|Jolie|Amir's Towing|2|1 hour later than promised
Steven|Wonder|Lotus Yoga|3|HOT Yoga! Plenty HOT!
sqlite>


4) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON businesses.id=reviews.business_id AND users.id=reviews.user_id WHERE businesses.name="Amir's Towing";
Amir's Towing|Angela|Jolie|2|1 hour later than promised
sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON businesses.id=reviews.business_id AND users.id=reviews.user_id WHERE businesses.name="Lotus Yoga";
Lotus Yoga|Bradford|Pitt|4|Great donuts
