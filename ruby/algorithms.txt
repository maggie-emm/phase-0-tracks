#Rel0: write algorithm for robot to use an elevator
#assumptions: 
 1) robby_the_robot (R2) knows how to walk and can understand english language
 2) can identify an elevator and knows that they carry people and supplies up and down multiple storied buildings so they don't have to use the stairs
 3) must be programmed how to use an elevator
 4) understands commands for using arms and fingers
 5) understands commands for identifying symbols; i.e., ^ = up, / = down, < = left, > = right, etc.
 6) understands shapes: round, square, triangle, etc.
 7) understands directiorns: front, back, rear, right, left, middle, etc.

-facing the elevator, observe a panel to either the right or left of the elevator
-observe a round button on the panel with a ^ symbol or the words up
-observa another round button below the ^ symbol with the symbol / or the words down
-depending on whether you are instructed to go up or down, you will activate the elevator by pressing the appropriate button
-you will be going up so raise right hand to an approximately 90 degree angle with pointer finger extended
-press the ^ arrow, observe the light will be activated which means the elevator has been programmed to come to your floor and wait for doors to open
-lower your arm to your side (default position)
-when elevator doors open, stand to the side of the doors to allow anyone riding the elevator who wants to come out to do so
-when all people who wish to exit the elevator have done so, walk into the elevator to about the middle of the space
-you will be facing the rear wall, turn 180 degrees so you are now facing the front where most doors are located (we will address elevators with doors in both front and back in another lesson)
-look at the walls to either side of the doors
-observe a panel that has round buttons with numbers associated with them
-you will be going to the 3rd floor
-raise your left hand approximately 90 degrees and press the button with the number 3 on it
-lower your arm to default position
-observe the light is activated which means the elevator is programmed to stop on that floor
-use this process anytime you want to go to any floor identified on the panel
-if your floor is not listed, CALL HOME R2 because you probably have received the wrong input
-when the elevator stops on the 3rd floor, the doors will open
-when the doors are completely open, walk out to hallway
-await further instructions
