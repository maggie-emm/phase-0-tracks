#pseudocode interior designer client intake form info

#welcome and introduction:
Marvelous Melvin; Your Adorable Meshugana Designer

# Prompt the designer/user for all of this information.


#create keys (symbols) :client's....:  name(str), age(int), children?(boolean) (y=#(int)), decor theme(str), 
# budget range(int), # bedrooms(int), # bathrms(int), most_imp_room(str), least_imp_room(str), 
# party animal?(boolean)


# Convert any user input to the appropriate data type.


# Print the hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered all of the questions.


# Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine). 
#     After all, sometimes users make mistakes! If the designer says "none", skip it. 
#     But if the designer enters "decor_theme" (for example), your program should ask 
#     for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. (Hint: Strings have methods that 
#     will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) You can assume the 
#     user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash -- no need to handle user errors.



# Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.
