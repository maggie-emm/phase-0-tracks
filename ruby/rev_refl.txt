Week 4 Review & Reflect Answer Questions

Variables
1. What is a variable? Why might a programmer use a variable?
A variable is a name (without quotes) that you give a value that allows the programmer to call it within the program.

2. If the value of first_name is "Abraham" and last_name is "Lincoln", explain the order in which Ruby will run the line full_name = first_name + last_name, and what the final result will be.
Ruby uses a right-side evaluation process. It evaluates the right side functions from left to right then assigns the result to the left side variable. EX:
  first_name = "Abraham"
  last_name = "Lincoln"
  full_name = first_name + last_name
  Ruby processes right side first from left to right: full_name => Abraham Lincoln
if
  first_name = "Abraham"
  last_name = "Lincoln"
  full_name = last_name + first_name
  full_name => Lincoln Abraham

Data Types
3. For each of the following data types, write a short definition and give at least one example of when you might use the data type in a program. (Don't use an example we've already provided.)
string=> a grouping of characters identified within "". Ex: string = "hum dinger"
integer=> a whole number, either postitve or negative. Ex: 5, 20000000, -32
float=> a decimal number, either positive or negative. Ex: 5.5, 20000000.2, -32.32323232
nil=> a variable with the value of nothing. Ex: middle_name = nil =>0
boolean=> a true or false value. Ex: "dog" == "cat" =>false; 4 >= 3 =>true

Algorithms
4. What is an algorithm?
In computer science, it is considered the steps that must be taken in the program to accomplish your goal. Typically, you would psuedocode your steps prior to actually writing the code.

5. What are two common categories of algorithm in computer science? 
Searching: find a specific name or item on a list of items
Sorting: alphabetize in a certain order (a to z; or z to a), when you order an item on Amazon, you may want to sort the response of your search by relevance, low to high price, or high to low price.

Methods
6. What is a method? Why might a programmer choose to use a method?
Reusable piece of code that does a specific task. A way of identifying repeatable code into a single block or unit of code. Programmers use methods to save time and make a program run more efficiently since they simply reuse repeatable code rather than repeat the code for each instance they want to run it.

7. Define the following terms as they relate to a method. 
return value: output, the value that shows up after the => ; i.e., 3*2=> 6 (6 is the return value), or "bring" + "string" => "bringstring" ("bringstring is the return value")
side effect: when a function or expression modifies its state, the expression is changed is an observable way
parameter: when defining a method; input; it is what's being defined by the procedure
argument: when you are calling a method
implicit return=> the last evaluated expression in a method is what is returned (3*2=> 6 (implicit return). It is implicit because the programmer doesn't need to use the code: return 3*2 in order to get the return value 

8. What are global scope and method scope? How do those scopes impact the availability of data at different points in a program?  Scope has to do with where something is visible. It's about what is available to the programmer at any given moment (the variables, the method or contents). Global is having everything available everywhere vs. method scope which is only certain things are available in a certain method; the variables. Global the data is available anywhere unlike the scope of data in a method which is only available in that certain place.

Control Flow
9. What is control flow? Why might a programmer choose to use flow control?
Control flow techniques using boolean variables and conditional statement code like with if/else, while & until are used to direct the program to take different actions based on different conditions. User input directs the specific response as written in the code. 
Programmers use control flow so that repetitive actions can be taken using the same & limited amount of code.

10. Define the following terms as they relate to flow control.
loop=> a bit of code that runs repeatedly UNTIL a specfied condition or boolean variable is met.
if=> whatever code is written on the same line following it has a value matching the identified valid_input, then the next line is run. The computer will take the 1st valid_input answer and return it.
else=> if none of the "if" statements return valid_input, the "else" condition is returned; it is the last condition.
elsif=> any additional conditions after the "if" and before the "else"; there can be many.
while=> a loop or repetitive code that stops when its condition is "false".
until=> repetitive code that runs until its condition is "true".
