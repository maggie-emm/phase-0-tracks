#pseudocode & write program for interior design client form
#identify all client info that will be needed
#include str, i && boolean types of data objects
#Types of Info:
#Category	keys       
#Contact :name_last, first	
#        :tn	
#        :address
#        :city
#        :state
#        :zip
#        :eml
#Family  :single
#        :children_y/n ; if y {:name, :age, :gender, :fav_theme}
#        :pets-y/n ; if y  :type, :number

#use symbols for keys unless a str is needed







#Prompt designer/user for all info
P "Please enter all appropriate fields."

#Convert any user input to appropriate data type






#Print hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered
#   all the questions



#Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop,
#   once is fine). If designer says "none", skip it. But if designer
#   enters "decor_theme" or any new key, program should ask for new
#   value and update the key. ****See the hint in challenge info***



#Print the latest version of hash & exit program.
