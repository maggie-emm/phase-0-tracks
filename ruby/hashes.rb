#pseudocode & write program for interior design client form
#identify all client info that will be needed
#include str, i && boolean types of data objects

#use symbols for keys unless a str is needed

#Prompt designer/user for all info

#Convert any user input to appropriate data type

#Print hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered
#   all the questions

#Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop,
#   once is fine). If designer says "none", skip it. But if designer
#   enters "decor_theme" or any new key, program should ask for new
#   value and update the key. ****See the hint in challenge info***

#Print the latest version of hash & exit program.
