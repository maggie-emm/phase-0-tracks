Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?

Data structures in Ruby can hold strings, integers, and any other Ruby object you're likely to use. They can even hold more data structures! After all, in keeping with the "everything is an object" philosophy of Ruby, data structures themselves are just objects as well.
