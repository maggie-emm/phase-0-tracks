What is HTML? In your answer, include definitions of the following:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language that is used to format most web pages. The HTML file uses the following:

- tag: formatting codes that identify to the web browser the parts of your web pages and how you want to lay them out
- element: syntax that allows the user to format their text in specific ways, like in a Word doc; i.e., make the text bold, italic, underlined, etc.
- node: devices or data points on a larger network
- attribute: is usually like a name-value pair with an HTML element; it specifies or gives additional meaning or value to the element it is associated with. 
- block element: usually identified within a <div>, <h1>-<h6>, <p> or <form>, starts a new line & formats your text in a rectangular shape
- inline element: usually identified within a <span>, <a>, or <img>, does not start a new line but formats the text inside

Very briefly, explain the purpose of the following elements:
- head: part of the root element that includes a title
- body: the tag that identifies the part of the file that contains your web page content
- p: a paragraph tag
- form: the tag the identifies the area that will contain form attributes
- div: division tags that divide content into meaningful sections
- span: an in-line level element that indicates the content will be displayed on the same line
- select: a form option element that identifies an HTML List Type Selector
- h2: header that has a lower priority than h1 but higher priority than h3-h6
- ol: ordered (numbered) list
- ul: unordered list usually with bullets or other indicater for each line
- table: (my fav) formatting text as in a grid or table
- tr: table row contains <th>table header</th> or <td>table data (data in that particular cell)</td>
