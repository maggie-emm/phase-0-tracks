<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? 
The semantic tags are used to put emphasis on the content; they describe what to expect as the nature and context of the content as identified by that tag name; i.e., <header> will be at the top and will tell you something about what the page contains.

Which ones do you see as most useful?
Depending on the purpose of the document will dictate the tags used. However, I can see using the section, nav, header & footer most often. Section to identify the theme to be displayed. The nav to link to related & supporting references. Header to introduce the topic and footer to identify authorship, contact info or other closing information.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
Main, header, nav, section, article, aside, footer

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? 
That it is a flexible, usable tool. I realized that when I open Subl appl the page defaults to plain text & that I have to change the type to HTML in order to get the HTML snippet to work.

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Absolutely, although it still confuses me. I can see how useful a tool it is when I want to write a page of documentation.  I can identify the order and write a snippet to populate my page then fill in the content arount the <x></x>. I can see it will be a timesaver and increase productivity when writing similar pages of content.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? 
Understanding about the snippet. It seemed like it was introduced with no introduction or set-up so I was really confused about what we were talking about. As I had time to reflect on it however, I found that I could visualize many applications for its use. I look forward to setting some up for practice.

How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Practice, practice, practice. That seems to be what this all boils down to for me. Once I have an opportunity to work through the challenge, reflect on it, then use it again in other exercises, I become more comfortable with them. I have limited opportunity to practice outside of the challenges now since I work FT.
