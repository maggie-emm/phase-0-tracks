<header>
	<h1>HEADER TAG:</h1>
	<p>Whatever header info you want</p></header>

<main>
	<h2>MAIN TAG:</h2>
		<p>The content inside the main element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.</p>

		<p>Note: There must not be more than one main element in a document. The main element must NOT be a descendant of an article, aside, footer, header, or nav element.</p>

		<section>
		<h2>SECTION TAG:</h2>
			<p>The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.</p>

			<p>Here are some <i>sections </i>you may find in the <b>Section</b> portion of your page and information on each:</p>

		<table border="2">
			<tr>
				<th>&nbsp;</th>
				<th>Chapter</th>
				<th>Header</th>
				<th>Footer</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>General</b></td>
				<td colspan="3">Text content as you might find in any document</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Detail</b></td>
				<td rowspan="2">Like chapters in a book. Content has a common theme</td>
				<td>H1 - H6</td>
				<td> * </td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Nice-to-Know</b></td>
				<td> * </td>
				<td>I prefer nav tags here</td>
			</tr>
			
		</table>
		<p>* This space left intentionally blank</p>

		</section>

		<article>
			<h3>ARTICLE TAG:</h3>
			
			<p>The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.</p>

			<p>An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.</p>

			<p>Potential sources for the article element:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Forum post</li>
					<li>Blog post</li>
					<li>News story</li>
					<li>Comment</li>
				</ul>
		</article>		

	<p>When you want specific content within the content you are displaying, use the aside tag.</p>
		<aside>
			<h3>ASIDE TAG:</h3>
			<p>The aside tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.</p>

			<p>The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.</p>
		</aside>
</main>

<footer>
<h3>FOOTER TAG:</h3>
<p>I like my nav tags in the footer rather than the header.</p>
	<nav>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/snippets.html">Read about how to create <i>Sublime Snippets</i> here</a></li>

<!-- REFLECT:
1) What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? 
	Semantic tags such as <form>, <table> and <img> clearly refer to the type of data that will be populated within that tag; a form to be filled out and submitted, a table providing content in a structured and formatted way, an img to illustrate the dev's point.
Which ones do you see as most useful?
	All are extremely useful, however, I must admit I am partial to tables.....I LOVE TABLES. I could structure tables all day long. I even created a snippet which I will share on Slack. I am so much less comfortable around forms so I will want to do a snippet for that and might as well do one for img while I'm at it.

2) What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The structure is based on an output tree, or parsing tree, that is a tree of DOM (Document Object Model) element & attribute nodes. OK, that's a mouthful. Basically, I believe this means that the "protocol" or order of the rendering is determined by a parsing algorithm inherent in the HTML5 specs. I think the algorithm see the HTML element flag which sets up the rendering process of looking for and seeing the Body Element. From what I researched, the algorithm allows the parsing of 2 elements simultaneously; i.e,. text & images.

3) What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	I learned so much about Sublime. I LOVE making snippets. They are truly fun. I learned how to create a new file, format it and save it. I will definitely do lots more.

4) What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
	Everytime I think I've got a better "GRIP on GIT", I get blown out of the water. I am trying not to become disheartened and frustrated rather to keep working at it. Many times my git messages and account  will clear up and I won't know why. I look forward to being able to increase my INTENTIONed use knowledge of Git .
