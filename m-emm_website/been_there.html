<p>Although I don't have any of my actual photos to share, I found several images that brought back wonderful memories. Of all the places I've traveled, I consider China to be my most exotic destination to date.</p>

<p>This is a photo of the Summer Palace and some of the ornately decorated pillars as you walk down the long corridor that goes to the lake on the Palace grounds.</p>
