<h1>I feel extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to visit so many places around the world.</h1>
<p>I consider myself a gypsy as I have done a considerable amount of traveling in my life. Some of the places I have visited are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I have crossed the US from coast-to-coast probable 10-12 times</li>
	<li>I've lived in Miami, FL; Charleston, SC; Southern California and the SF Bay Area</li>
</ul>
<h3>Come join me as I share some of my reflections and thoughts</h3>

<p>Although I don't have any of my actual photos to share, I found several images that brought back wonderful memories. Of all the places I've traveled, I consider China to be my most exotic destination to date.</p>

<p>This is a photo of the Summer Palace and some of the ornately decorated pillars as you walk down the long corridor that goes to the lake on the Palace grounds.</p>
