# Git Definitions for Coyote 2016; August

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  - Version Control is the ability to update data in files and merge it into the master file. It is useful because several people can work on different areas of code independently then fold it back into the master file.

What is a branch and why would you use one?

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  - A branch is essential in effective coding because the integrity of the master branch can be maintained until updates and changes can be tested and ok'd. I would use a branch whenever I am making changes to any code so I can track my changes, identify the type of change and revert back to the master branch if bugs or errors are encountered.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  - A commit attaches an identifying message to changes I make in the code so that I can track the updates, changes & corrections I make to code. Commit messages should be clear and reflect the update made.

* What is a merge conflict?
  - A merge conflict occurs when 2 different changes are made to the same line of code. This must be resolved because the computer will not know which action to take.

* TAG!! =D  You're it, Glenna!
