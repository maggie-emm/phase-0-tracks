Week 3: Review & Reflect Questions:

1) Name at least three categories of CSS adjustments (example: colors)?
	font-size: (value can be in px, %, or many settings like: small, x-small, large, xx-large, etc.)
	text-align: (value can be left, right, center, justify)
	padding: (by itself pads the outside of the content box or can identify specific padding sides (top, left, right, bottom) in px, or %)

2) What are the three ways to link a CSS rule to an HTML document? Which one is the best and why?
	linking a CSS rule to an HTML document can be done via class (<section class="intro"> on html & .intro on css file), id (<p id="trouble"> on html & #trouble on css file) or selector (on css identify the selector you want everything with that selector tag to have the styling applied to: html {} will apply the style to the entire document).

	not sure there is a "best" as each one has its own uses. If i want entire doc styled according to the CSS Properties I've defined, I use the selector. If there is 1 selector that I want styled a certain way, I use the #id. If several of same selector, best to use class.

3) What is a selector? Give examples of at least three types of selectors.
	Selectors are the HTML elements; i.e.,
		<div>
		<p>
		<section>

4) What is the box model?
	Box model identifies how html is set up:
		margin	(specifies space from viewport edges)
		border	(outside the padding)
		padding (surrounds content)
		content (center)

5) Explain and give an example of the cascading effect of CSS.
	Cascading effect of CSS means there is a flow of properties from the top down up to 4 different levels; 
		Level 1: style attribute
		Level 2: <style> element
		Level 3: any style defined in an external style sheet (like a "styles.css" file that is linked to the HTML file)
		Level 4: settings in the user's browser

		An example is if you have not applied any style to your HTML code yet you do have a linked .css file, then all the style is applied as a result of Level 3.

		Another example is if you have style applied at Level 3 (say a text-decoration: blink; property, but the user views only on Chrome, not Mozilla (only browser supporting it), then it will not be displayed to the user.

6) Name two CSS techniques that assist in responsive design.
		1) Use the Dev Tools feature (View / Developer / Developer Tools) in the browswer to resize the viewport window to see the best way to adjust your Media Query for the device you are designing for.
		2) Use Dev Tools' mobile device preview (page may require refresh after clicking mobile phone icon & adjusting for device type and page orientation)
